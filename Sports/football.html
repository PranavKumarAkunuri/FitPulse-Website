            Basic Rules and Regulations of Football
        </h2>
    
       <h3> It is one of the most crucial football rules for the game.</h3>
        <ol>
    <li>A football match has two teams playing against each other.</li>
    <li>The number of players in each team should be a minimum of 7 and must not exceed 11.</li>
    <li>Four categories of players are there in a football match. Goalkeeper, defenders, midfielders, and forwards.</li>
    <li>There must be one player designated as a goalkeeper in each team. If a goalkeeper is unavailable/suspended, any position player can become the designated goalkeeper.</li>
    <li>Each team is led by a captain, whose one official responsibility is to represent the team at the coin toss before the kick-off or penalty kicks.</li>
    <li>Winning the coin toss means your team gets to choose the initial direction of play. The direction of both teams switches after half time before the second half starts. The team that loses the toss does the first kick-off and starts.</li>

        <h2>Dribblong Drill</h2>
        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <p>The objective of the drill is to help the players keep the ball at a short pace, an attribute that is expected of a good dribbler. This will help their touch and control of the ball.</p>
        <h4>setup</h4>
        <p>10 cones on a straight line at an equidistance apart. Distance may be between 0.8m to 1.5m</p>
        <h4>Execution</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>The trainer stands at the sideline when he blows the whistle, and he kicks the ball at a very high velocity to the player standing by the first cone.</li>
            <li>The player must control the ball well and start dribbling through the cone.</li>
            <li>Players practice dribbling through the cones with the inside of both feet, outside of both feet; inside and outside of the right foot; inside and outside of the left foot.</li>
            <li>On getting to the last cone, the player must make quick touches with the ball and get back to the first cone at the fastest of their pace.</li>
            <li>Repeat as the coach instructs.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Coaching Tips</h4>
        <p>The drill must be performed with total concentration. This drill will help the players keep the ball better even when under pressure.</p>

    <div id="passing-drill">
        <h2>Passing Drill</h2>
        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <p>This soccer passing drill is suitable for almost any age level, focusing on passing, receiving, and turning skills. Great warmup drill for players to pass and move.</p>
        <h4>setup</h4>
        <p>The players are divided in four lines that form a square, with one player starting in the middle of the square.</p>
        <h4>Execution</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>The passing pattern starts with one of the soccer balls being passed to the player in the middle.</li>
            <li>The player in the middle receives the pass, turns 180 degrees, passes to the opposite line, and follows the pass to go to the back of that line.</li>
            <li>After the first pass, the player who passed the ball then runs into the middle to receive the second soccer ball. This player will then receive the ball, turn 180 degrees, pass to the opposite line, and follow the pass to the back of the line. The same process as the first player.</li>
            <li>This process repeats itself for the decided upon amount of time.</li>
            <li>Repeat as the coach instructs.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Execution</h4>
        <ol>
