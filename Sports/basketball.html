        Basic Rules and Regulations of basketball
    </h2>
        <h3>Offensive Rules</h3>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>The player must bounce, or dribble, the ball with one hand while moving both feet. If, at any time, both hands touch the ball or the player stops dribbling, the player must only move one foot. The foot that is stationary is called the pivot foot.</li>
          <li>The basketball player can only take one turn at dribbling. In other words, once a player has stopped dribbling they cannot start another dribble. A player who starts dribbling again is called for a double-dribbling violation and looses the basketball to the other team. 
          A player can only start another dribble after another player from either team touches or gains control of the basketball. This is usually after a shot or pass.
        <li>The ball must stay in bounds. If the offensive team looses the ball out of bounds the other team gets control of the basketball.</li>
        <li> The players hand must be on top of the ball while dribbling. If they touch the bottom of the basketball while dribbling and continue to dribble this is called carrying the ball and the player will lose the ball to the other team.</li>
        <li>Once the offensive team crosses half court, they may not go back into the backcourt. This is called a backcourt violation. If the defensive team knocks the ball into the backcourt, then the offensive team can recover the ball legally.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
        <h3>Defensive Rules</h3>
       
        <p>The team on defense is the team without the basketball.</p> 
        <p>
            <ol>
            <li>The main rule for the defensive player is not to foul.
             A foul is described as gaining an unfair advantage through physical contact. 
             There is some interpretation that has to be made by the referee, but, in general, the defensive player may not touch the offensive player in a way that causes the offensive player to lose the ball or miss a shot.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Shooting Drill</h2>
        <h4>Purpose</h4>
        <p>Players work on their shooting form</p>

        <h4>drill setup</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Players pair up and line up across from each other on different sides of the lane.</li>
            <li>One player of each pair has a basketball.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>How it works</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Player with the ball starts by holding it out front on one hand.</li>
            <li>He then locks and loads into shooting position, putting the ball into the shooting pocket. The off hand stays off the ball.</li>
            <li>The player then shoots for the stars. He goes through his shooting motion and shoots a high, soft shot, letting the ball go out in front of him.</li>
            <li>Player holds follow-through until ball hits the court.</li>
            <li>The opposite player grabs the ball and then goes through the above steps.</li>
            <li>Once they get the hang of it, each player grabs their own ball. Set up 3-5 feet from the basket and take one-handed form shots at the basket.</li>
            <li>If a player makes 3 consecutive shots, he takes a step back. Repeat until the player reaches the free throw line.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h4>Coaching Tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Younger players should be practicing this drill with a smaller size ball and lower nets appropriate for their age group</li>
            <li>The shot’s power should be coming primarily from the legs. Players should not need to hoist it up using a chest-push or throw it from the shoulder.</li>
            <li>Wrist should be bent back in the load position so the ball is on a pedestal.</li>
            <li>Players should be extending their shooting arm up and forming a parachute on the follow through.</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="dribbling-drills">
        <h2>Dribbling Drills</h2>
        <h4>Purpose</h4>
        <p>Players work on their dribbling skills</p>

        <h4>drill setup</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Start holding the ball with two hands at about ankle length
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How it works</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Start wrapping the ball around your ankles, then slowly begin to move up to the knees.</li>
            <li>Wrap the ball around your hips.</li>
            <li>Then up around your head and shoulders.</li>
            <li>Go back down to your ankles doing the same thing in the opposite direction.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Coaching Tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Swing the ball around your body as many times as possible on both the way up and down</li>
            <li>Keep your head up</li>
            <li>Go as fast as you can to increase the difficulty</li>      
        </ul>

    <div id="passing-drills">
        <h2>Basketball Drills for Passing</h2>
        <h4>Purpose</h4>
        <p>Players learn to properly execute a one-handed flick pass.</p>

        <h4>drill setup</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Players pair off and line up across from each other in the lane area.</li>
            <li>Each player should be on the edge of the lane</li>
            <li>One player has a ball</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>How it works</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Player with ball passes to the other player</li>
            <li>They take turns passing the ball back and forth using a flick pass, snapping the wrist and releasing the ball with one hand.</li>
            <li>Start with the right-hand flick pass, then move on to the left-hand flick pass.</li>
            <li>Rule of thumb - work weak hand three times more than strong hand</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Coaching Tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Passers start in triple threat position, catchers catch in triple threat position.</li>
            <li>With a flick pass, players should step to throw and snap the wrist.</li>
            <li>Follow through with your passing hand extended and fingers pointed</li> 
            <li>Catch the ball with "feet in the air" meaning you should jump forward to aggressively receive the ball</li>   
        </ul>

        <h2>Basketball Drills for defence</h2>
        <h4>Purpose</h4>
        <p>Players learn the proper fundamentals of a defensive stance.</p>

        <h4>drill setup</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Have your entire team stand with their backs to a bench, bleachers, or a row of chairs.</li>
            <li>If there's not enough space for the entire team, split the team in half and take turns.</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h4>How it works</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>On the coach's signal, all the players will sit back slowly into the chair.</li>
            <li>Assume the defensive stance position while sitting - feet shoulder width apart, back straight, head up, hands in front, palms up.</li>
            <li>On the coach's signal, rise out of the chair while staying in the defensive stance.</li>
            <li>Hold that position for 10-15 seconds.</li>
            <li> On the coach's signal, take one step and slide to the right. Then one step and slide to the left</li>
            <li> Sit back down and repeat.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Coaching Tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>This is a great chance to walk through the ranks and review individual defensive stances. Make corrections, point out the best stances.</li>
            <li>Keep the head level and torso centered on the step and slide. Maintain the space between your feet - never cross the feet over.</li>
            <li>This can also work as a conditioning drill if you have players hold the defensive stance for an extended period</li>  
        </ul>
